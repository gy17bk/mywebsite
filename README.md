=====================
This is demo data created

This is the source code for my personal Github website. MIT licensed. I uploaded my CV, has my student e-mail address and added my github page link as well.

I used this site as a template and starting point:
http://hankquinlan.github.io/ as i wanted to create something simple and useful.
As well added some hand coded HTML and some css codes using this site: https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
Please note that all colours and wallpapers are intentional, i just wanted to play with the different colours.
